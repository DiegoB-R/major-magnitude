# Major Magnitude — Frontend (Astro)

This repository (on branch `frontend`) contains the frontend application built with Astro.

Current status (2025-11-06):

- The frontend is implemented in Astro and lives on the `frontend` branch of this repository.
- The project is currently undergoing framework migration changes and active modifications — do not expect `main` to contain source code.

Notes:

- `main` intentionally contains only documentation and project notes. Feature and development work happens on `frontend` (for UI) and on the external backend repository.
- The canonical backend repository is hosted separately and maintained independently.

If you need the source code to work on the frontend, fetch or checkout the `frontend` branch:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout frontend
```
